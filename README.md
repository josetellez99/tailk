This project is an app to practice languages with an AI.

It's a telgram like app where each chat is a AI under the hood talking with you.

I believe using the language is the best way to learn it. But sometimes finding people to practice could be hard or you feel shy using the language you're learning.

That's the why this exits, an easy way to practice laguages through text, voice message and calls that help you feel confidente to then, go to talk with real persons.
